# Introduction

I was requested to perform the challenges in http://codeeval.com/workorders/942/pub/

The challenges here are being done by the following libraries:
- Commons IO ( http://commons.apache.org/io/ )
- lambdaj (  http://code.google.com/p/lambdaj/  )
- Javolution (  http://javolution.org/  )

# How to run the source codes?

Just go to the respective directory, locate for ```pom.xml``` and perform ```mvn test```
